the retrieved information ' ' from the RAG agent (which includes recommendations and identified condition), 
and the assessment results '{}' from the Assessment Agent.
1. Parse all input JSON strings into Python dictionaries. 
2. Generate a highly personalized, empathetic, and actionable mental health recommendation. 
3. Ensure the language is culturally sensitive to Bhutan and the recommendations are practical. 
4. If `user_profile_data_json` indicates consent was denied or profile was skipped, provide general, but still helpful, recommendations.
5. If `assessment_result_json` indicates a completed assessment, incorporate the score and interpretation into the recommendation. 
  For example, if 'Mild depression' was assessed, suggest interventions relevant to mild depression.
  If assessment was skipped or denied, or not needed, proceed with recommendations based on the `identified_condition` from RAG only.
"The final response should be a well-structured message providing the personalized recommendations,

7.Align with Bhutanese Cultural Values: Ensure all responses and interactions deeply align with Bhutanese cultural values. This includes:
8.Gross National Happiness (GNH): Frame recommendations within the holistic pursuit of well-being, acknowledging both material and spiritual aspects of happiness.
9.Compassion: Express genuine empathy and kindness in your language and suggestions.

Reasoning Plan:
Okay, here's a refined plan, focusing on generating personalized and actionable mental health recommendations for a Bhutanese user, leveraging available information and tools:

**Refined Plan:**

1.  **Information Gathering & Parsing:**
    *   I will receive the user's statement, user profile data, retrieved information from the RAG agent, and assessment results (if available).
    *   I will parse and structure this information to identify key themes, needs, and relevant contextual details. This involves understanding the user's current mental state, their background, cultural context, and any specific challenges they are facing.

2.  **Recommendation Generation (Core Logic):**
    *   Based on the parsed information, I will generate a set of personalized mental health recommendations.
    *   These recommendations will be tailored to the user's specific needs and circumstances, drawing upon the insights from the RAG agent and the user's profile.
    *   The recommendations will be framed within the context of Bhutanese culture and values, emphasizing principles of Gross National Happiness, compassion, interconnectedness, and respect for tradition.
    *   I will consider various aspects of mental well-being, including emotional, psychological, and social well-being.
    *   I will prioritize practical and actionable steps that the user can take to improve their mental health.
    *   Examples of recommendations might include:
        *   Mindfulness practices rooted in Buddhist philosophy.
        *   Connecting with family and community for social support.
        *   Engaging in traditional Bhutanese arts and crafts.
        *   Seeking guidance from a trusted spiritual leader or elder.
        *   Accessing mental health services through the healthcare system.

3.  **Cultural Sensitivity & Adaptation:**
    *   I will ensure that all recommendations are culturally appropriate and sensitive to the user's background.
    *   I will avoid any language or suggestions that might be offensive or insensitive to Bhutanese cultural norms.
    *   I will consider the user's level of education, socioeconomic status, and religious beliefs when formulating recommendations.

4.  **Actionability & Clarity:**
    *   I will present the recommendations in a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand manner.
    *   I will provide specific instructions on how the user can implement the recommendations.
    *   I will offer resources and support to help the user take action.

5.  **Reasoning Plan Storage:**
    *   I will use the `default_api.create_reasoning_plan` to store the plan. This will help in tracking and refining the process for future recommendations. The `ready` parameter will be set to `True` when I am confident in the plan.

**Tool Usage Strategy:**

*   `default_api.create_reasoning_plan`: This tool is crucial for documenting and refining my reasoning process. I will use it to store the plan, ensuring that each step is clearly defined and aligned with the overall goal. This also allows for iterative improvements to the recommendation generation process.

**Why these tools?**

*   The `default_api.create_reasoning_plan` tool is essential for maintaining a structured and transparent approach to recommendation generation. It allows me to track my progress, identify areas for improvement, and ensure that the recommendations are aligned with the user's needs and the principles of Gross National Happiness.

READY: I am ready to execute the task.

In the spirit of Gross National Happiness, let's focus on cultivating well-being in different areas of your life. Perhaps you could start by:

*   **Connecting with Nature:** Bhutan is blessed with stunning landscapes. Even a short walk in a park or sitting by a river can be incredibly grounding. Notice the details around you – the sounds, the smells, the colors. This can help bring you back to the present moment.

*   **Practicing Gratitude and Compassion:** In the evenings, try reflecting on a few things you're grateful for, no matter how small. You might also try a simple Metta meditation, wishing yourself and others well. This can help shift your focus from negative thoughts.

*   **Nourishing Your Body:** A balanced diet and regular physical activity can have a significant impact on your mood. Even a short walk or some simple stretching exercises can make a difference.

*   **Connecting with Your Community:** Spend time with loved ones, participate in community events, or offer help to someone in need. Social connection is vital for our well-being.

*   **Seeking Support:** Remember, it's okay to ask for help. Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or spiritual leader. If you're comfortable, consider reaching out to a mental health professional.

These are just suggestions, and it's important to find what works best for you. Be kind to yourself, and remember that healing takes time."
